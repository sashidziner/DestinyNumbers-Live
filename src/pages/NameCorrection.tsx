      q: 'What if I love my current name?',
      a: `That is completely understandable — and you never have to change a name you love.

However, if your name's total numerical vibration is not aligned with your date of birth, that misalignment silently creates friction — in health, relationships, and career — regardless of how much you love the name itself.

The concern deepens when your partner's date of birth and your date of birth carry an anti-combination — opposing numerical energies that conflict rather than complement. In such cases, aligning your name vibration becomes not just beneficial but essential — it acts as the bridge that brings harmony between two opposing frequencies.

The good news: in most cases this does not require changing your name entirely. A small correction in spelling — one or two letters — is often all it takes to shift the vibration into alignment.`
    },
    {
      q: 'Can a name correction really change my life?',
      a: `Yes — and here is the science behind why.

Your name is not just an identity. It is a vibrational frequency you repeat, hear, write, and receive thousands of times every year. Every time your name is spoken or written, that frequency is activated — compounding its energetic impact on your health, relationships, career, and opportunities over months and years.

There are two levels of name correction — and understanding the difference is critical:

Spelling Adjustment — Partial Alignment
Adding or removing a letter brings your name into numerical alignment with your date of birth. This is a valid correction and does create a positive shift. However, because the core sound and identity of the name remains largely unchanged, the vibrational impact — while real — is gradual and moderate.

Full Name Correction — Complete Alignment
When the name itself is corrected to fully align with your date of birth vibration, the impact is significantly deeper. The frequency you carry, respond to, and project into the world changes at its root — and so do the opportunities, people, and circumstances that are drawn toward you.

Think of it this way — a spelling adjustment tunes the instrument. A full name correction changes the entire frequency it plays in.

The honest answer: Both work. But the depth of your transformation is directly proportional to the depth of the correction you are willing to make.`
    },
    {
      q: 'How long does the consultation take?',
      a: 'A full Name Numerology session typically runs 60–90 minutes, followed by a written report and any subsequent follow-up questions you may have.'
    },
    {
      q: 'Is this different from Baby Name Numerology?',
      a: `Yes — they share the same science but serve two very different purposes.

Baby Name Numerology — A Foundation For Life
Baby Name Numerology is the art of giving a newborn the most powerful vibrational start possible. A name chosen at birth — before any life patterns have formed — becomes the frequency the child grows into, responds to, and carries through every chapter of their life.

It is arguably the most meaningful gift a parent can give. Not a toy. Not a tradition. A lifelong vibrational blueprint that silently shapes the child's health, character, relationships, and destiny from their very first day.

At Destiny Numbers, Baby Name Numerology goes one layer deeper — integrating the child's Nakshatra vibration into the name selection. A name aligned with both the birth date and the birth Nakshatra creates a rare triple harmony — numerological, phonetic, and cosmic — that amplifies the child's natural strengths and provides energetic protection through life's most challenging phases.

Name Numerology for Adults — Correction and Realignment
Adult Name Numerology addresses a different reality. You have been carrying your name for years — perhaps decades. Life patterns, recurring challenges, and relationship dynamics have already formed around its vibration. The work here is analytical and corrective — studying the name you have lived with, identifying where its frequency conflicts with your date of birth, and realigning it to restore harmony and open what has been blocked.`
