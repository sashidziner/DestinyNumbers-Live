              Every letter in your business name has a numerical value. Every numerical value carries a planetary energy — the disciplined drive of Saturn, the expansive abundance of Jupiter, the magnetic charm of Venus, the bold leadership of the Sun.

              When these energies align with the birth charts of the business founders and the nature of the venture itself, something powerful happens. Growth feels less forced. The right clients find you. Partnerships form naturally. Revenue compounds.

              When they do not align, you will feel it — in the constant uphill effort, in deals that fall apart at the last moment, in the sense that you are working twice as hard as competitors for half the results.

This is not coincidence. Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs — from ancient trading dynasties to modern tech founders — have consulted numerologists at pivotal moments in their business journey.
